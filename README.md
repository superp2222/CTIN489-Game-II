# Question & Hypothesis
### Can a fixed input loop create tension and attention-switching without any 3D exploration?
### Hypothesis: If players must enter a long floor sequence while brief interruptions occur, they may feel pressured compared to a calm keypad entry

# Gameplay
### Mouse
Use mouse to enter the correct sequence of numbers to reach the alternate dimension.
